## Projects
### Benchmarks of Deep learning models to predict wind speed of Typhoons in the North-West Pacific

Under the direction of Kitamoto Sensei in Tokyo, I realized trained several models to predict the intensity of Typhoons. I used a database created by Kitamoto Sensei which gathers pictures in a range of 40 years.

## Talks & Lectures
- Workshop in Yokohama University to present my work on Typhoons to students and professors in meteorology.
